I am unable to resolve this issue. The error `Failed opening required 'C:\Anguvel\anguvel-backend/vendor/autoload.php': No such file or directory` indicates that the PHP dependencies for the `anguvel-backend` project are not installed. Typically, these are installed by running `composer install`. However, I am operating in a non-interactive mode and do not have permission to execute `composer` or `php` commands directly via `run_shell_command`. Therefore, I cannot install the required dependencies to make `php artisan serve` work.
